== Description ==

# MemberData Ranking management

This is a plugin extension to the MemberData plugin, allowing the user to create a ranking for elements in the MemberData
data store, based on configurable values and selectable fields.

The extension creates a Dashboard submenu entry under the MemberData main entry, called 'Ranking'.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this work =

The formula applied is displayed in the Settings tab in the Dashboard entry for this plugin. Once the plugin is configured, you
can enter match results in the first tab ('Matches'). Each match in sequence will be evaluated according to the formula and the
configured values. The 'rank' type attributes of the associated MemberData collection will then be updated with the latest
ranking value. The current ranking list is visible using name and group under the 'Ranking' tab.
